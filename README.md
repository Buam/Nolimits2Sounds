## How to use

### 1. **[Download](https://github.com/Emonadeo/Nolimits2Sounds/releases/latest) the latest release and unpack it into your park directory.**

### 3. **Assign any desired sound to a section.**

![Guide](https://i.imgur.com/6ZLpG96.png)

1. **Select the section you want to add a sound to** (Can be a lift, station or block brake)

2. **Open Type Settings** (Or double-click the section directly)

3. **Rename the section to the sound's name** *(See example below)*  
    > **Multiple Sections:** You can't give two sections the same name. If you want to use the same sound on multiple sections, append the name by an underscore (`_`) and a number counting upwards starting from 1.  
    **Roar Sounds**: If you want to add a roar sound, you can name any unused section *(i.e. station, lift or block brake)*. Roar sounds are always played and not limited to that section.    

4. **Done**
