## How to use

1. [Download](https://github.com/Emonadeo/Nolimits2Sounds/releases/latest) the latest release and copy it inside your park directory.

2. Add the Script to a coaster. **Note:** It is not needed to change the coaster's operation mode to scripted.
> *Add from File* `->` *Sounds.nl2script*

3. You can now add any sound by naming sections. Some sounds are only applied to a single section, others apply globally.
For example the sound `bm_lift` which applies the B&M Lift sound will only play on the section it is defined to. However when naming a section `bm_roar` the B&M Roar will be played on the entire coaster.

4. Switch to Play Mode and enjoy :)
